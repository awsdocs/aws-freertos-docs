# Downloading FreeRTOS for Porting<a name="porting-download"></a>

Before you begin porting FreeRTOS to your platform, you need to download FreeRTOS or clone the FreeRTOS repository from [GitHub](https://github.com/aws/amazon-freertos)\. See the [README\.md](https://github.com/aws/amazon-freertos/blob/master/README.md) file for instructions\.

**Note**  
We recommend that you clone the repository\. Cloning makes it easier for you to pick up updates to the master branch as they are pushed to the repository\.

After you download or clone FreeRTOS, you can start porting FreeRTOS code to your platform\. For instructions, see [Setting Up Your FreeRTOS Source Code for Porting](porting-set-up-project.md), and then see [Porting the FreeRTOS Libraries](afr-porting.md)\.

**Note**  
Throughout FreeRTOS documentation, the FreeRTOS download is referred to as `freertos`\.
