# Downloading Amazon FreeRTOS for Porting<a name="porting-download"></a>

Before you begin porting Amazon FreeRTOS to your platform, you need to download Amazon FreeRTOS or clone the Amazon FreeRTOS repository from [GitHub](https://github.com/aws/amazon-freertos)\. See the [README\.md](https://github.com/aws/amazon-freertos/blob/master/README.md) file for instructions\.

**Note**  
We recommend that you clone the repository\. Cloning makes it easier for you to pick up updates to the master branch as they are pushed to the repository\.

After you download or clone Amazon FreeRTOS, you can start porting Amazon FreeRTOS code to your platform\. For instructions, see [Setting Up Your Amazon FreeRTOS Source Code for Porting](porting-set-up-project.md), and then see [Porting the Amazon FreeRTOS Libraries](afr-porting.md)\.

**Note**  
Throughout Amazon FreeRTOS documentation, the Amazon FreeRTOS download is referred to as `<amazon-freertos>`\.
