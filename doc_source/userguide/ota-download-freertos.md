You can download Amazon FreeRTOS from the [Amazon FreeRTOS Console](freertos-ocw.md), or you can clone or download Amazon FreeRTOS from [GitHub](https://github.com/aws/amazon-freertos)\. See the [ README\.md](https://github.com/aws/amazon-freertos/blob/master/README.md) file for instructions\.

To include the OTA library in the Amazon FreeRTOS configuration that you download from the console, you can customize a predefined configuration, or you can create a configuration for a platform that supports OTA functionality\. On the **Configure Amazon FreeRTOS Software** configuration properties page, under **Libraries**, choose **OTA Updates**\. Under **Demo projects**, you can choose to enable the OTA demo\. You can also enable the demo manually later on\.
