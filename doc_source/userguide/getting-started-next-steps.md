# Next steps with FreeRTOS<a name="getting-started-next-steps"></a>

After you build, flash, and run the FreeRTOS demo project for your board, you can visit the FreeRTOS\.org webite to learn more about [ Creating a New FreeRTOS Project](https://www.freertos.org/Creating-a-new-FreeRTOS-project.html)\. There are also demos for many FreeRTOS libraries that show how to perform important tasks, interact with AWS IoT services, and program board\-specific capabilities \(such as cellular modems\)\. For more information, see the [FreeRTOS Library Categories](https://www.freertos.org/libraries/categories.html) page\. 

The FreeRTOS\.org website also has in\-depth information on [ the FreeRTOS Kernel](https://www.freertos.org/RTOS.html) as well as fundamental real\-time operating system concepts\. For more information, see the [FreeRTOS Kernel Developer Docs](https://www.freertos.org/features.html) and [FreeRTOS Kernel Secondary Docs](https://www.freertos.org/kernel/secondarydocs.html) pages\.
