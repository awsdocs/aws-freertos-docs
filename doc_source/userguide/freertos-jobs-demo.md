# AWS IoT Jobs library demo<a name="freertos-jobs-demo"></a>

## Introduction<a name="freertos-jobs-demo-introduction"></a>

The AWS IoT Jobs library demo shows you how to connect to the [AWS IoT Jobs service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-jobs.html) through an MQTT connection, retrieve a job from AWS IoT, and process it on a device\. The AWS IoT Jobs demo project uses the [ FreeRTOS Windows port](https://www.freertos.org/FreeRTOS-Windows-Simulator-Emulator-for-Visual-Studio-and-Eclipse-MingW.html), so it can be built and evaluated with the [Visual Studio Community](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/) version on Windows\. No microcontroller hardware is needed\. The demo establishes a secure connection to the AWS IoT MQTT broker using TLS  in the same manner as the [coreMQTT mutual authentication demo](mqtt-demo-ma.md)\.

**Note**  
To set up and run the FreeRTOS demos, follow the steps in [Getting Started with FreeRTOS](freertos-getting-started.md)\.

## Source code organization<a name="freertos-jobs-demo-source-code-org"></a>

The demo code is in the `jobs_demo.c` file and can be found on the [GitHub](https://github.com/aws/amazon-freertos/blob/main/demos/jobs_for_aws/jobs_demo.c) website or in the `freertos/demos/jobs_for_aws/` directory\.

## Configure the AWS IoT MQTT broker connection<a name="freertos-jobs-demo-configure-mqtt-broker"></a>

In this demo, you use an MQTT connection to the AWS IoT MQTT broker\. This connection is configured in the same  way as the [coreMQTT mutual authentication demo](mqtt-demo-ma.md)\.

## Functionality<a name="freertos-jobs-demo-functionality"></a>

The demo shows the workflow used to receive jobs from AWS IoT and process them on a device\. The demo is interactive and requires you to create jobs by using either the AWS IoT console or the AWS Command Line Interface \(AWS CLI\)\. For more information about creating a job, see [create\-job](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/iot/create-job.html) in the *AWS CLI Command Reference*\. The demo requires the job document to have an `action` key set to `print` to print a message to the console\.

See the following format for this job document\.

```
{
    "action": "print",
    "message": "ADD_MESSAGE_HERE"
}
```

You can use the AWS CLI to create a job as in the following example command\.

```
aws iot create-job \
    --job-id t12 \
    --targets arn:aws:iot:region:123456789012:thing/device1 \
    --document '{"action":"print","message":"hello world!"}'
```

The demo also uses a job document that has the `action` key set to `publish` to republish the message to a topic\. See the following format for this job document\.

```
{
    "action": "publish",
    "message": "ADD_MESSAGE_HERE",
    "topic": "topic/name/here"
}
```

The demo loops until it receives a job document with the `action` key set to `exit` to exit the demo\. The format for the job document is as follows\.

```
{
    "action: "exit"
}
```

### Entry point of the Jobs demo<a name="freertos-jobs-demo-functionality-entry-point"></a>

The source code for the Jobs demo entry point function can be found on  [ GitHub](https://github.com/aws/amazon-freertos/blob/main/demos/jobs_for_aws/jobs_demo.c#L773-L967)\. This function performs the following operations:

1. Establish an MQTT connection using the helper functions in `mqtt_demo_helpers.c`\.

1. Subscribe to the MQTT topic for the `NextJobExecutionChanged` API, using helper functions in `mqtt_demo_helpers.c`\. The topic string is assembled earlier, using macros defined by the AWS IoT Jobs library\.

1. Publish to the MQTT topic for the `StartNextPendingJobExecution` API, using helper functions in `mqtt_demo_helpers.c`\. The topic string is assembled earlier, using macros defined by the AWS IoT Jobs library\.

1. Repeatedly call `MQTT_ProcessLoop` to receive incoming messages which are handed to `prvEventCallback` for processing\.

1. After the demo receives the exit action, unsubscribe from the MQTT topic and disconnect, using the helper functions in the `mqtt_demo_helpers.c` file\.

### Callback for received MQTT messages<a name="freertos-jobs-demo-functionality-callback"></a>

The [ prvEventCallback](https://github.com/aws/amazon-freertos/blob/main/demos/jobs_for_aws/jobs_demo.c#L674-L769) function calls `Jobs_MatchTopic` from the AWS IoT Jobs library to classify the incoming MQTT message\. If the message type corresponds to a new job, `prvNextJobHandler()` is called\.

The [ prvNextJobHandler](https://github.com/aws/amazon-freertos/blob/main/demos/jobs_for_aws/jobs_demo.c#L601-L670) function, and the functions it calls, parse the job document from the JSON\-formatted message, and run the action specified by the job\. Of particular interest is the `prvSendUpdateForJob` function\.

### Send an update for a running job<a name="freertos-jobs-demo-functionality-send-update"></a>

The function [ prvSendUpdateForJob\(\)](https://github.com/aws/amazon-freertos/blob/main/demos/jobs_for_aws/jobs_demo.c#L413-L457) calls `Jobs_Update()` from the Jobs library to populate the topic string used in the MQTT publish operation that immediately follows\.
