# Bluetooth Low Energy demo applications<a name="ble-demo"></a>

## Overview<a name="ble-demo-overview"></a>

FreeRTOS Bluetooth Low Energy includes three demo applications:
+ [MQTT over Bluetooth Low Energy](#ble-demo-mqtt) demo 

  This application demonstrates how to use the MQTT over Bluetooth Low Energy service\.
+ [Wi\-Fi provisioning](#ble-demo-wifi) demo

  This application demonstrates how to use the Bluetooth Low Energy Wi\-Fi Provisioning service\.
+ [Generic Attributes Server](#ble-demo-server) demo

  This application demonstrates how to use the FreeRTOS Bluetooth Low Energy middleware APIs to create a simple GATT server\.

**Note**  
To set up and run the FreeRTOS demos, follow the steps in [Getting Started with FreeRTOS](freertos-getting-started.md)\.

## Prerequisites<a name="ble-demo-prereqs"></a>

To follow along with these demos, you need a microcontroller with Bluetooth Low Energy capabilities\. You also need the [iOS SDK for FreeRTOS Bluetooth devices](freertos-ble-mobile.md#freertos-ble-ios) or the [Android SDK for FreeRTOS Bluetooth devices](freertos-ble-mobile.md#freertos-ble-android)\.

### Set up AWS IoT and Amazon Cognito for FreeRTOS Bluetooth Low Energy<a name="set-up-ble-demo-aws"></a>

To connect your devices to AWS IoT across MQTT, you need to set up AWS IoT and Amazon Cognito\.

**To set up AWS IoT**

1. Set up an AWS account on [https://aws\.amazon\.com/](https://aws.amazon.com/)\.

1. Open the [AWS IoT console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iot/), and from the navigation pane, choose **Manage**, and then choose **Things**\.

1. Choose **Create**, and then choose **Create a single thing**\.

1. Enter a name for your device, and then choose **Next**\.

1. If you are connecting your microcontroller to the cloud through a mobile device, choose **Create thing without certificate**\. Because the Mobile SDKs use Amazon Cognito for device authentication, you do not need to create a device certificate for demos that use Bluetooth Low Energy\.

   If you are connecting your microcontroller to the cloud directly over Wi\-Fi, choose **Create certificate**, choose **Activate**, and then download the thing's certificate, public key, and private key\.

1. Choose the thing that you just created from the list of registered things, and then choose **Interact** from your thing's page\. Make a note of the AWS IoT REST API endpoint\.

For more information about setting up, see the [Getting Started with AWS IoT](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-gs.html)\.

**To create an Amazon Cognito user pool**

1. Open the Amazon Cognito console, and choose **Manage User Pools**\.

1. Choose **Create a user pool**\.

1. Give the user pool a name, and then choose **Review defaults**\.

1. From the navigation pane, choose **App clients**, and then choose **Add an app client**\.

1. Enter a name for the app client, and then choose **Create app client**\.

1. From the navigation pane, choose **Review**, and then choose **Create pool**\.

   Make a note of the pool ID that appears on the **General Settings** page of your user pool\.

1. From the navigation pane, choose **App clients**, and then choose **Show details**\. Make a note of the app client ID and app client secret\.

**To create an Amazon Cognito identity pool**

1. Open the Amazon Cognito console, and choose **Manage Identity Pools**\.

1. Enter a name for your identity pool\.

1. Expand **Authentication providers**, choose the **Cognito** tab, and then enter your user pool ID and app client ID\.

1. Choose **Create Pool**\.

1. Expand **View Details**, and make a note of the two IAM role names\. Choose **Allow** to create the IAM roles for authenticated and unauthenticated identities to access Amazon Cognito\.

1. Choose **Edit identity pool**\. Make a note of the identity pool ID\. It should be of the form `us-west-2:12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012`\.

For more information about setting up Amazon Cognito, see the [Getting Started with Amazon Cognito](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-getting-started.html)\.

**To create and attach an IAM policy to the authenticated identity**

1. Open the IAM console, and from the navigation pane, choose **Roles**\.

1. Find and choose your authenticated identity's role, choose **Attach policies**, and then choose **Add inline policy**\.

1. Choose the **JSON** tab, and paste the following JSON:

   ```
   {
      "Version":"2012-10-17",
      "Statement":[
         {
            "Effect":"Allow",
            "Action":[
               "iot:AttachPolicy",
               "iot:AttachPrincipalPolicy",
               "iot:Connect",
               "iot:Publish",
               "iot:Subscribe",
               "iot:Receive",
               "iot:GetThingShadow",
               "iot:UpdateThingShadow",
               "iot:DeleteThingShadow"
            ],
            "Resource":[
               "*"
            ]
         }
      ]
   }
   ```

1. Choose **Review policy**, enter a name for the policy, and then choose **Create policy**\.

Keep your AWS IoT and Amazon Cognito information on hand\. You need the endpoint and IDs to authenticate your mobile application with the AWS Cloud\.

### Set up your FreeRTOS environment for Bluetooth Low Energy<a name="ble-demo-set-up"></a>

To set up your environment, you need to download FreeRTOS with the [Bluetooth Low Energy library](freertos-ble-library.md) on your microcontroller, and download and configure the Mobile SDK for FreeRTOS Bluetooth Devices on your mobile device\.

**To set up your microcontroller's environment with FreeRTOS Bluetooth Low Energy**

1. Download or clone FreeRTOS from [GitHub](https://github.com/aws/amazon-freertos)\. See the [README\.md](https://github.com/aws/amazon-freertos/blob/main/README.md) file for instructions\.

1. Set up FreeRTOS on your microcontroller\.

   For information about getting started with FreeRTOS on a FreeRTOS\-qualified microcontroller, see the guide for your board in [Getting Started with FreeRTOS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/freertos/latest/userguide/freertos-getting-started.html)\.
**Note**  
You can run the demos on any Bluetooth Low Energy\-enabled microcontroller with FreeRTOS and ported FreeRTOS Bluetooth Low Energy libraries\. Currently, the FreeRTOS [MQTT over Bluetooth Low Energy](#ble-demo-mqtt) demo project is fully ported to the following Bluetooth Low Energy\-enabled devices:  
[Espressif ESP32\-DevKitC and the ESP\-WROVER\-KIT](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/freertos/latest/userguide/getting_started_espressif.html)
[Nordic nRF52840\-DK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/freertos/latest/userguide/getting_started_nordic.html)

## Common components<a name="ble-demo-common"></a>

The FreeRTOS demo applications have two common components:
+ Network Manager
+ Bluetooth Low Energy Mobile SDK demo application

### Network Manager<a name="ble-demo-network-manager"></a>

Network Manager manages your microcontroller's network connection\. It is located in your FreeRTOS directory at `demos/network_manager/aws_iot_network_manager.c`\. If the Network Manager is enabled for both Wi\-Fi and Bluetooth Low Energy, the demos start with Bluetooth Low Energy by default\. If the Bluetooth Low Energy connection is disrupted, and your board is Wi\-Fi\-enabled, the Network Manager switches to an available Wi\-Fi connection to prevent you from disconnecting from the network\.

To enable a network connection type with the Network Manager, add the network connection type to the `configENABLED_NETWORKS` parameter in `vendors/vendor/boards/board/aws_demos/config_files/aws_iot_network_config.h` \(where the *vendor* is the name of the vendor and the *board* is the name of the board that you are using to run the demos\)\.

For example, if you have both Bluetooth Low Energy and Wi\-Fi enabled, the line that starts with `#define configENABLED_NETWORKS` in `aws_iot_network_config.h` reads as follows:

```
#define  configENABLED_NETWORKS  ( AWSIOT_NETWORK_TYPE_BLE | AWSIOT_NETWORK_TYPE_WIFI )
```

To get a list of currently supported network connection types, see the lines that begin with `#define AWSIOT_NETWORK_TYPE` in `aws_iot_network.h`\.

### FreeRTOS Bluetooth Low Energy Mobile SDK demo application<a name="ble-sdk-app"></a>

The FreeRTOS Bluetooth Low Energy Mobile SDK demo application is located on GitHub at [Android SDK for FreeRTOS Bluetooth Devices](https://github.com/aws/amazon-freertos-ble-android-sdk) under `amazon-freertos-ble-android-sdk/app` and the [iOS SDK for FreeRTOS Bluetooth Devices](https://github.com/aws/amazon-freertos-ble-ios-sdk) under `amazon-freertos-ble-ios-sdk/Example/AmazonFreeRTOSDemo`\. In this example, we use screenshots of the iOS version of the demo mobile application\.

**Note**  
If you are using an iOS device, you need Xcode to build the demo mobile application\. If you are using an Android device, you can use Android Studio to build the demo mobile application\.
