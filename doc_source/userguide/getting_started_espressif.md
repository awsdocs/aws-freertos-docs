      source vendors/espressif/esp-idf/export.sh
      ```

### Establish a serial connection

   To establish a serial connection between your host machine and the ESP32\-DevKitC, you must install the CP210x USB to UART Bridge VCP drivers\. You can download these drivers from [ Silicon Labs](https://www.silabs.com/products/development-tools/software/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers)\.

   To establish a serial connection between your host machine and the ESP32\-WROVER\-KIT, you must install the FTDI virtual COM port driver\. You can download this driver from [FTDI](https://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/VCP.htm)\.

   For more information, see [ Establish Serial Connection with ESP32](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/release-v4.2/esp32/get-started/establish-serial-connection.html)\. After you establish a serial connection, make a note of the serial port for your board's connection\. You need it to flash the demo\.

### Configure the FreeRTOS demo applications

For this tutorial, the FreeRTOS configuration file is located at `freertos/vendors/espressif/boards/board-name/aws_demos/config_files/FreeRTOSConfig.h`\. \(For example, if `AFR_BOARD espressif.esp32_devkitc` is chosen, the configuration file is located at `freertos/vendors/espressif/boards/esp32/aws_demos/config_files/FreeRTOSConfig.h`\.\) 

1. If you're running macOS or Linux, open a terminal prompt\. If you're running Windows, open the "ESP\-IDF 4\.x CMD" app \(if you included this option when you installed the ESP\-IDF toolchain\), or the "Command Prompt" app otherwise\.  

1. To verify that you have Python3 installed, run 

   ```
   python --version
   ```

   The version installed is displayed\. If you don't have Python 3\.0\.1 or later installed, you can install it from the [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) website\.

1. You need the AWS Command Line Interface \(CLI\) to run AWS IoT commands\. If you're running Windows, use the `easy_install awscli` command to install the AWS CLI in the "Command" or "ESP\-IDF 4\.x CMD" app\. 

   If you're running macOS or Linux, see [Installing the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/installing.html)\. 

1. Run

   ```
   aws configure
   ```

   and configure the AWS CLI with your AWS access key ID, secret access key, and default AWS Region\. For more information, see [Configuring the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html)\.

1. Use the following command to install the AWS SDK for Python \(boto3\):
   + On Windows, in the "Command" or "ESP\-IDF 4\.x CMD" app,  run

     ```
     easy_install boto3
     ```
   + On macOS or Linux, run

     ```
     pip install tornado nose --user
     ```

     and then run

     ```
     pip install boto3 --user
     ```

   FreeRTOS includes the `SetupAWS.py` script to make it easier to set up your Espressif board to connect to AWS IoT\. To configure the script, open `freertos/tools/aws_config_quick_start/configure.json` and set the following attributes:  
**`afr_source_dir`**  
The complete path to the `freertos` directory on your computer\. Make sure that you use forward slashes to specify this path\.  
**`thing_name`**  
The name that you want to assign to the AWS IoT thing that represents your board\.  
**`wifi_ssid`**  
The SSID of your Wi\-Fi network\.  
**`wifi_password`**  
The password for your Wi\-Fi network\.  
**`wifi_security`**  
The security type for your Wi\-Fi network\.  
The following are valid security types:  
   + `eWiFiSecurityOpen` \(Open, no security\)
   + `eWiFiSecurityWEP` \(WEP security\)
   + `eWiFiSecurityWPA` \(WPA security\)
   + `eWiFiSecurityWPA2` \(WPA2 security\)

1. Run the configuration script\.

   1. If you're running macOS or Linux, open a terminal prompt\. If you're running Windows, open the "ESP\-IDF 4\.x CMD" or "Command" app\. 

   1. Navigate to the `freertos/tools/aws_config_quick_start` directory and run 

      ```
      python SetupAWS.py setup
      ```

      The script does the following:
      + Creates an IoT thing, certificate, and policy\.
      + Attaches the IoT policy to the certificate and the certificate to the AWS IoT thing\.
      + Populates the `aws_clientcredential.h` file with your AWS IoT endpoint, Wi\-Fi SSID, and credentials\.
      + Formats your certificate and private key and writes them to the `aws_clientcredential_keys.h` header file\.
**Note**  
The certificate is hardcoded for demonstration purposes only\. Production\-level applications should store these files in a secure location\.

      For more information about `SetupAWS.py`, see the `README.md` in the `freertos/tools/aws_config_quick_start` directory\.

### Monitoring MQTT messages on the cloud<a name="gsg-espressif-monitor-mqtt"></a>

Before you run the FreeRTOS demo project, you can set up the MQTT client in the AWS IoT console to monitor the messages that your device sends to the AWS Cloud\.

**To subscribe to the MQTT topic with the AWS IoT MQTT client**

1. Navigate to the [AWS IoT console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iotv2/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Test**, then choose **MQTT Test Client**\.

1. In **Subscription topic**, enter `your-thing-name/example/topic`, and then choose **Subscribe to topic**\.

When the demo project successfully runs on your device you see "Hello World\!" sent multiple times to the topic that you subscribed to\.

### Build, flash, and run the FreeRTOS demo project using the idf\.py script<a name="build-and-run-example-espressif-idf42"></a>

You can use Espressif's IDF utility \(`idf.py`\) to build the project and flash the binaries onto your device\.

**Note**  
Some setups might require that you use the port option `"-p port-name"` with `idf.py` to specify the correct port, as in the following example\.  

```
idf.py -p /dev/cu.usbserial-00101301B flash
```

**Build and flash FreeRTOS on Windows, Linux, and macOS \(ESP\-IDF v4\.2\)**

1. Navigate to the root of your FreeRTOS download directory\.

1. In a command line window, enter the following command to add the ESP\-IDF tools to your terminal's PATH\.  
**Windows \("Command" app\)**  

   ```
   vendors\espressif\esp-idf\export.bat
   ```  
**Windows \("ESP\-IDF 4\.x CMD" app\)**  
\(This has already been done when you opened the app\.\)  
**Linux / macOS**  

   ```
   source vendors/espressif/esp-idf/export.sh
   ```

1. Configure cmake in the `build` directory and build the firmware image with the following command\.

   ```
   idf.py -DVENDOR=espressif -DBOARD=esp32_wrover_kit -DCOMPILER=xtensa-esp32 build
   ```

   You should see output like the following\.

   ```
      Running cmake in directory /path/to/hello_world/build
      Executing "cmake -G Ninja --warn-uninitialized /path/to/hello_world"...
      Warn about uninitialized values.
      -- Found Git: /usr/bin/git (found version "2.17.0")
      -- Building empty aws_iot component due to configuration
      -- Component names: ...
      -- Component paths: ...
   
      ... (more lines of build system output)
   
      [527/527] Generating hello-world.bin
      esptool.py v2.3.1
   
      Project build complete. To flash, run this command:
      ../../../components/esptool_py/esptool/esptool.py -p (PORT) -b 921600 write_flash --flash_mode dio --flash_size detect --flash_freq 40m 0x10000 build/hello-world.bin  build 0x1000 build/bootloader/bootloader.bin 0x8000 build/partition_table/partition-table.bin
      or run 'idf.py -p PORT flash'
   ```

   If there are no errors, the build will generate the firmware binary \.bin files\.

1. Erase your development board's flash memory with the following command\.

   ```
   idf.py erase_flash
   ```

1. Use the `idf.py` script to flash the application binary to your board\.

   ```
   idf.py flash
   ```

1. Monitor the output from your board's serial port with the following command\.

   ```
   idf.py monitor
   ```
**Note**  
You can combine these commands such as in the following example\.  

   ```
   idf.py erase_flash flash monitor
   ```

   For certain host machine setups, you must specify the port when you flash the board such as in the following example\.

   ```
   idf.py erase_flash flash monitor -p /dev/ttyUSB1
   ```

### Build and Flash FreeRTOS with CMake<a name="flash-espressif-cmake-idf42"></a>

In addition to the `idf.py` script provided by the IDF SDK to build and run your code, you can also build the project with CMake\. Currently, it supports either Unix Makefiles or the Ninja build system\.

**To build and flash the project**

1. In a command line window, navigate to the root of your FreeRTOS download directory\.

1. Run the following script to add the ESP\-IDF tools to your shell's PATH\.  
**Windows**  

   ```
   vendors\espressif\esp-idf\export.bat
   ```  
**Linux / macOS**  

   ```
   source vendors/espressif/esp-idf/export.sh
   ```

1. Enter the following command to generate the build files\.  
**With Unix Makefiles**  

   ```
   cmake -DVENDOR=espressif -DBOARD=esp32_wrover_kit -DCOMPILER=xtensa-esp32 -S . -B ./YOUR_BUILD_DIRECTORY -DAFR_ENABLE_ALL_MODULES=1 -DAFR_ENABLE_TESTS=0
   ```  
**With Ninja**  

   ```
   cmake -DVENDOR=espressif -DBOARD=esp32_wrover_kit -DCOMPILER=xtensa-esp32 -S . -B ./YOUR_BUILD_DIRECTORY -DAFR_ENABLE_ALL_MODULES=1 -DAFR_ENABLE_TESTS=0 -GNinja
   ```

1. Build the project\.  
**With Unix Makefiles**  

   ```
   make -C ./YOUR_BUILD_DIRECTORY -j8 
   ```  
**With Ninja**  

   ```
   ninja -C ./YOUR_BUILD_DIRECTORY -j8
   ```

1. Erase the flash and then flash the board\.  
**With Unix Makefiles**  

   ```
   make -C ./YOUR_BUILD_DIRECTORY erase_flash
   ```

   ```
   make -C ./YOUR_BUILD_DIRECTORY flash
   ```  
**With Ninja**  

   ```
   ninja -C ./YOUR_BUILD_DIRECTORY erase_flash
   ```

   ```
   ninja -C ./YOUR_BUILD_DIRECTORY flash
   ```

## Run the Bluetooth Low Energy demos<a name="espressif-run-ble"></a>

FreeRTOS supports [Bluetooth Low Energy library](freertos-ble-library.md) connectivity\.

To run the FreeRTOS demo project across Bluetooth Low Energy, you must run the FreeRTOS Bluetooth Low Energy Mobile SDK Demo Application on an iOS or Android mobile device\.

**To set up the FreeRTOS Bluetooth Low Energy mobile SDK demo application**

1. Follow the instructions in [Mobile SDKs for FreeRTOS Bluetooth devices](freertos-ble-mobile.md) to download and install the SDK for your mobile platform on your host computer\.

1. Follow the instructions in [FreeRTOS Bluetooth Low Energy Mobile SDK demo application](ble-demo.md#ble-sdk-app) to set up the demo mobile application on your mobile device\.

For instructions about how to run the MQTT over Bluetooth Low Energy demo on your board, see [MQTT over Bluetooth Low Energy](ble-demo.md#ble-demo-mqtt)\.

For instructions about how to run the Wi\-Fi provisioning demo on your board, see [Wi\-Fi provisioning](ble-demo.md#ble-demo-wifi)\.

## Using FreeRTOS in your own CMake project for ESP32<a name="getting_started_espressif_cmake_project"></a>

If you want to consume FreeRTOS in your own CMake project, you can set it up as a subdirectory and build it together with your application\. First, get a copy of FreeRTOS either from [GitHub](https://github.com/aws/amazon-freertos) or from the [FreeRTOS console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/freertos)\. If you're using Git, you can also set it up as a Git submodule with the following command so it's easier to update in the future\.

```
git submodule add -b release https://github.com/aws/amazon-freertos.git freertos
```

If a later version is released, you can update your local copy with these commands\.

```
# Pull the latest changes from the remote tracking branch.
git submodule update --remote -- freertos
```

```
# Commit the submodule change because it is pointing to a different revision now.
git add freertos
```

```
git commit -m "Update FreeRTOS to a new release"
```

If your project has the following directory structure: 

```
- freertos (the copy that you obtained from GitHub or the AWS IoT console)
- src
  - main.c (your application code)
- CMakeLists.txt
```

Then the following is an example of the top\-level `CMakeLists.txt` file that can be used to build your application together with FreeRTOS\.

```
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.13)

project(freertos_examples)

# Tell IDF build to link against this target.
set(IDF_EXECUTABLE_SRCS "<complete_path>/src/main.c")
set(IDF_PROJECT_EXECUTABLE my_app)

# Add FreeRTOS as a subdirectory. AFR_BOARD tells which board to target.
set(AFR_BOARD espressif.esp32_devkitc CACHE INTERNAL "")
add_subdirectory(freertos)

# Link against the mqtt library so that we can use it. Dependencies are transitively
# linked.
target_link_libraries(my_app PRIVATE AFR::core_mqtt)
```

To build the project, run the following CMake commands\. Make sure the ESP32 compiler is in the PATH environment variable\.

```
cmake -S . -B build-directory -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=freertos/tools/cmake/toolchains/xtensa-esp32.cmake -GNinja 
```

```
cmake --build build-directory 
```

To flash the application to your board, run the following command\.

```
cmake --build build-directory --target flash 
```

### Using components from FreeRTOS<a name="getting_started_espressif_cmake_project_components"></a>

```

You can reference any components from the `Modules to build` list\. To link them into your application, put the `AFR::` namespace in front of the name, for example, `AFR::core_mqtt`, `AFR::ota`, and so on\.

### Add custom components using ESP\-IDF<a name="getting_started_espressif_cmake_project_espidf"></a>

You can add more components while using ESP\-IDF\. For example, assuming you want to add a component called `example_component`, and your project looks like this:

```
- freertos
- components
  - example_component
    - include
      - example_component.h
    - src
      - example_component.c
    - CMakeLists.txt
- src
  - main.c
- CMakeLists.txt
```

The following is an example of the `CMakeLists.txt` file for your component\. 

```
add_library(example_component src/example_component.c)
target_include_directories(example_component PUBLIC include)
```

Then, in the top level `CMakeLists.txt` file, add the component by inserting the following line just after `add_subdirectory(freertos)`\.

```
add_subdirectory(component/example_component) 
```

Then, modify `target_link_libraries` to include your component\.

```
target_link_libraries(my_app PRIVATE AFR::core_mqtt PRIVATE example_component) 
```

This component is now automatically linked to your application code by default\. You can now include its header files and call the functions it defines\.

### Override the configurations for FreeRTOS<a name="getting_started_espressif_cmake_project_override"></a>

There's currently no well\-defined approach to redefining the configs outside of the FreeRTOS source tree\. By default, CMake will look for the `freertos/vendors/espressif/boards/esp32/aws_demos/config_files/` and `freertos/demos/include/` directories\. However, you can use a workaround to tell the compiler to search other directories first\. For example, you can add another folder for FreeRTOS configurations\.

```
- freertos
- freertos-configs
  - aws_clientcredential.h
  - aws_clientcredential_keys.h
  - iot_mqtt_agent_config.h
  - iot_config.h
- components
- src
- CMakeLists.txt
```

The files under `freertos-configs` are copied from the `freertos/vendors/espressif/boards/esp32/aws_demos/config_files/` and `freertos/demos/include/` directories\. Then, in your top level `CMakeLists.txt` file, add this line before `add_subdirectory(freertos)` so that the compiler will search this directory first\.

```
include_directories(BEFORE freertos-configs)
```

### Providing your own sdkconfig for ESP\-IDF<a name="getting_started_espressif_providing_sdkconfig"></a>

In case you want to provide your own `sdkconfig.default`, you can set the CMake variable `IDF_SDKCONFIG_DEFAULTS`, from the command line:

```
cmake -S . -B build-directory -DIDF_SDKCONFIG_DEFAULTS=path_to_your_sdkconfig_defaults -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=freertos/tools/cmake/toolchains/xtensa-esp32.cmake -GNinja 
```

If you don't specify a location for your own `sdkconfig.default` file, FreeRTOS uses the default file located at `freertos/vendors/espressif/boards/esp32/aws_demos/sdkconfig.defaults`\.

For more information, see [Project Configuration](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/v4.2-beta1/esp32s2/api-reference/kconfig.html) in the Espressif *API Reference* and, if you encounter issues after you have successfully compiled, see the section on [ Deprecated options and their replacements](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/v4.2-beta1/esp32s2/api-reference/kconfig.html#deprecated-options-and-their-replacements) on that page\.

### Summary<a name="getting_started_espressif_cmake_project_summary"></a>

If you have a project with a component called `example_component`, and you want to override some configurations, here's a complete example of the top level `CMakeLists.txt` file\.

```
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.13)

project(freertos_examples)

set(IDF_PROJECT_EXECUTABLE my_app)
set(IDF_EXECUTABLE_SRCS "src/main.c")

# Tell IDF build to link against this target.
set(IDF_PROJECT_EXECUTABLE my_app)

# Add some extra components. IDF_EXTRA_COMPONENT_DIRS is a variable used by ESP-IDF
# to collect extra components.
get_filename_component(
    EXTRA_COMPONENT_DIRS
    "components/example_component" ABSOLUTE
)
list(APPEND IDF_EXTRA_COMPONENT_DIRS ${EXTRA_COMPONENT_DIRS})

# Override the configurations for FreeRTOS.
include_directories(BEFORE freertos-configs)

# Add FreeRTOS as a subdirectory. AFR_BOARD tells which board to target.
set(AFR_BOARD espressif.esp32_devkitc CACHE INTERNAL "")
add_subdirectory(freertos)

# Link against the mqtt library so that we can use it. Dependencies are transitively
# linked.
target_link_libraries(my_app PRIVATE AFR::core_mqtt)
```

## Troubleshooting<a name="getting_started_espressif_troubleshooting"></a>
+ If you're running macOS and the operating system doesn't recognize your ESP\-WROVER\-KIT, make sure you don't have the D2XX drivers installed\. To uninstall them, follow the instructions in the [ FTDI Drivers Installation Guide for macOS X](http://www.ftdichip.com/Support/Documents/AppNotes/AN_134_FTDI_Drivers_Installation_Guide_for_MAC_OSX.pdf)\.
+ The monitor utility provided by ESP\-IDF \(and invoked using make monitor\) helps you decode addresses\. For this reason, it can help you get some meaningful backtraces in the event the application stops working\. For more information, see [ Automatic Address Decoding](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/release-v4.2/esp32/api-guides/tools/idf-monitor.html#automatic-address-decoding) on the Espressif website\.
+ It's also possible to enable GDBstub for communication with gdb without requiring any special JTAG hardware\. For more information, see [ Launching GDB with GDBStub](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/release-v4.2/esp32/api-guides/tools/idf-monitor.html#launching-gdb-with-gdbstub) on the Espressif website\.
+ For information about setting up an OpenOCD\-based environment if JTAG hardware\-based debugging is required, see [ JTAG Debugging](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/api-guides/jtag-debugging/index.html) on the Espressif website\.
+ If `pyserial` can't be installed using `pip` on macOS, download it from the [pyserial website](https://pypi.org/simple/pyserial)\.
+ If the board resets continuously, try erasing the flash by entering the following command on the terminal\.

  ```
  make erase_flash
  ```
+ If you see errors when you run `idf_monitor.py`, use Python 2\.7\.
+ Required libraries from ESP\-IDF are included in FreeRTOS, so there is no need to download them externally\. If the `IDF_PATH` environment variable is set, we recommend that you clear it before you build FreeRTOS\.
+ On Windows, it can take 3\-4 minutes for the project to build\. To reduce the build time, you can use the `-j4` switch on the make command\.

  ```
  make flash monitor -j4
  ```
+ If your device has trouble connecting to AWS IoT, open the `aws_clientcredential.h` file, and verify that the configuration variables are properly defined in the file\. `clientcredentialMQTT_BROKER_ENDPOINT[]` should look like `1234567890123-ats.iot.us-east-1.amazonaws.com`\.
+ If you're following the steps in [Using FreeRTOS in your own CMake project for ESP32](#getting_started_espressif_cmake_project) and you see undefined reference errors from the linker, it's usually because of missing dependent libraries or demos\. To add them, update the `CMakeLists.txt` file \(under the root directory\) using the standard CMake function `target_link_libraries`\.
+ ESP\-IDF v4\.2 supports the use of the *xtensa\\\-esp32\\\-elf\\\-gcc 8\\\.2\\\.0\\\.* toolchain\. If you're using an earlier version of the Xtensa toolchain, download the required version\.
+ If you see an error log like the following about python dependencies that are not being met for ESP\-IDF v4\.2:

  ```
  The following Python requirements are not satisfied:
    click>=5.0
    pyserial>=3.0
    future>=0.15.2
    pyparsing>=2.0.3,<2.4.0
    pyelftools>=0.22
    gdbgui==0.13.2.0
    pygdbmi<=0.9.0.2
    reedsolo>=1.5.3,<=1.5.4
    bitstring>=3.1.6
    ecdsa>=0.16.0
    Please follow the instructions found in the "Set up the tools" section of ESP-IDF Getting Started Guide
  ```

  Install the python dependencies on your platform using the following Python command:

  ```
  root/vendors/espressif/esp-idf/requirements.txt
  ```

## Debugging<a name="getting_started_espressif_debugging"></a>

### Debugging code on Espressif ESP32\-DevKitC and ESP\-WROVER\-KIT \(ESP\-IDF v4\.2\)<a name="debugging-espressif-idf42"></a>

This section shows you how to debug Espressif hardware using ESP\-IDF v4\.2\. You need a JTAG to USB cable\. We use a USB to MPSSE cable \(for example, the [ FTDI C232HM\-DDHSL\-0](http://www.ftdichip.com/Products/Cables/USBMPSSE.htm)\)\.

**ESP\-DevKitC JTAG setup**  
For the FTDI C232HM\-DDHSL\-0 cable, these are the connections to the ESP32 DevkitC\.  

```
| C232HM-DDHSL-0 Wire Color | ESP32 GPIO Pin | JTAG Signal Name |
| ------------------------- | -------------- | ---------------- |
|  Brown (pin 5)            |  IO14          |  TMS             |
|  Yellow (pin 3)           |  IO12          |  TDI             |
|  Black (pin 10)           |  GND           |  GND             |
|  Orange (pin 2)           |  IO13          |  TCK             |
|  Green (pin 4)            |  IO15          |  TDO             |
```

**ESP\-WROVER\-KIT JTAG setup**  
For the FTDI C232HM\-DDHSL\-0 cable, these are the connections to the ESP32\-WROVER\-KIT\.  

```
| C232HM-DDHSL-0 Wire Color | ESP32 GPIO Pin | JTAG Signal Name |
| ------------------------- | -------------- | ---------------- |
|  Brown (pin 5)            |  IO14          |  TMS             |
|  Yellow (pin 3)           |  IO12          |  TDI             |
|  Orange (pin 2)           |  IO13          |  TCK             |
|  Green (pin 4)            |  IO15          |  TDO             |
```
These tables were developed from the [ FTDI C232HM\-DDHSL\-0 datasheet](https://www.ftdichip.com/Support/Documents/DataSheets/Cables/DS_C232HM_MPSSE_CABLE.pdf)\. For more information, see the section "C232HM MPSSE Cable Connection and Mechanical Details in the data sheet\.  
To enable JTAG on the ESP\-WROVER\-KIT, place jumpers on the TMS, TDO, TDI, TCK, and S\_TDI pins as shown here\.  

![\[Jumper placement\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/freertos/latest/userguide/images/JP8-jumpers.png)

**Debugging on Windows \(ESP\-IDF v4\.2\)**  

**To set up for debugging on Windows**

1. Connect the USB side of the FTDI C232HM\-DDHSL\-0 to your computer and the other side as described in [Debugging code on Espressif ESP32\-DevKitC and ESP\-WROVER\-KIT \(ESP\-IDF v4\.2\)](#debugging-espressif-idf42)\. The FTDI C232HM\-DDHSL\-0 device should appear in **Device Manager** under **Universal Serial Bus Controllers**\.

1. Under the list of universal serial bus devices, right\-click the **C232HM\-DDHSL\-0** device, and then choose **Properties**\.
**Note**  
The device might be listed as **USB Serial Port**\.

   To see the properties of the device, in the properties window, choose the **Details** tab\. If the device isn't listed, install the [Windows driver for FTDI C232HM\-DDHSL\-0](http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/D2XX.htm)\.

1. On the **Details** tab, choose **Property**, and then choose **Hardware IDs**\. You should see something like this in the **Value** field\.

   ```
   FTDIBUS\COMPORT&VID_0403&PID_6014
   ```

   In this example, the vendor ID is 0403 and the product ID is 6014\.

   Verify these IDs match the IDs in `projects/espressif/esp32/make/aws_demos/esp32_devkitj_v1.cfg`\. The IDs are specified in a line that begins with `ftdi_vid_pid` followed by a vendor ID and a product ID\.

   ```
   ftdi_vid_pid 0x0403 0x6014
   ```

1. Download [OpenOCD for Windows](https://github.com/espressif/openocd-esp32/releases)\.

1. Unzip the file to `C:\` and add `C:\openocd-esp32\bin` to your system path\.

1. OpenOCD requires libusb, which is not installed by default on Windows\. To install libusb:

   1. Download [zadig\.exe](https://zadig.akeo.ie)\.

   1. Run `zadig.exe`\. From the **Options** menu, choose **List All Devices**\.

   1. From the dropdown menu, choose **C232HM\-DDHSL\-0**\.

   1. In the target driver field, to the right of the green arrow, choose **WinUSB**\.

   1. For the list under the target driver field, choose the arrow, and then choose **Install Driver**\. Choose **Replace Driver**\.

1. Open a command prompt, navigate to the root of your FreeRTOS download directory, and run the following command\.

   ```
   idf.py openocd
   ```

   Leave this command prompt open\.

1. Open a new command prompt, navigate to the root of your FreeRTOS download directory, and run

   ```
   idf.py flash monitor
   ```

1. Open another command prompt, navigate to the root of your FreeRTOS download directory, and wait until the demo starts running on your board\. When it does, run

   ```
   idf.py gdb
   ```

   The program should stop in the `main` function\.
**Note**  
The ESP32 supports a maximum of two break points\.

**Debugging on macOS \(ESP\-IDF v4\.2\)**  

1. Download the [FTDI driver for macOS](http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/VCP.htm)\.

1. Download [OpenOCD](https://github.com/espressif/openocd-esp32/releases)\. 

1. Extract the downloaded \.tar file and set the path in `.bash_profile` to `OCD_INSTALL_DIR/openocd-esp32/bin`\.

1. Use the following command to install `libusb` on macOS\.

   ```
   brew install libusb
   ```

1. Use the following command to unload the serial port driver\.

   ```
   sudo kextunload -b com.FTDI.driver.FTDIUSBSerialDriver
   ```

1. Use the following command to unload the serial port driver\.

   ```
   sudo kextunload -b com.FTDI.driver.FTDIUSBSerialDriver
   ```

1. If you're running a macOS version later than 10\.9, use the following command to unload the Apple FTDI driver\.

   ```
   sudo kextunload -b com.apple.driver.AppleUSBFTDI
   ```

1. Use the following command to get the product ID and vendor ID of the FTDI cable\. It lists the attached USB devices\.

   ```
   system_profiler SPUSBDataType
   ```

   The output from `system_profiler` should look like the following\.

   ```
      DEVICE:
   
      Product ID: product-ID
      Vendor ID: vendor-ID (Future Technology Devices International Limited)
   ```

1. Open the `projects/espressif/esp32/make/aws_demos/esp32_devkitj_v1.cfg` file\. The vendor ID and product ID for your device are specified in a line that begins with `ftdi_vid_pid`\. Change the IDs to match the IDs from the `system_profiler` output in the previous step\.

1. Open a terminal window, navigate to the root of your FreeRTOS download directory, and use the following command to run OpenOCD\.

   ```
   idf.py openocd
   ```

   Leave this terminal window open\.

1. Open a new terminal, and use the following command to load the FTDI serial port driver\.

   ```
   sudo kextload -b com.FTDI.driver.FTDIUSBSerialDriver
   ```

1. Navigate to the root of your FreeRTOS download directory, and run 

   ```
   idf.py flash monitor
   ```

1. Open another new terminal, navigate to the root of your FreeRTOS download directory, and run

   ```
   idf.py gdb
   ```

   The program should stop at `main`\.

**Debugging on Linux \(ESP\-IDF v4\.2\)**  

1. Download [OpenOCD](https://github.com/espressif/openocd-esp32/releases)\. Extract the tarball and follow the installation instructions in the readme file\.

1. Use the following command to install libusb on Linux\.

   ```
   sudo apt-get install libusb-1.0
   ```

1. Open a terminal and enter ls \-l /dev/ttyUSB\* to list all USB devices connected to your computer\. This helps you check if the board's USB ports are recognized by the operating system\. You should see output like the following\.

   ```
      $ls -l /dev/ttyUSB*
      crw-rw----    1    root    dialout    188,    0    Jul    10    19:04    /dev/ttyUSB0
      crw-rw----    1    root    dialout    188,    1    Jul    10    19:04    /dev/ttyUSB1
   ```

1. Sign off and then sign in and cycle the power to the board to make the changes take effect\. In a terminal prompt, list the USB devices\. Make sure the group owner has changed from `dialout` to `plugdev`\.

   ```
      $ls -l /dev/ttyUSB*
      crw-rw----    1    root    plugdev    188,    0    Jul    10    19:04    /dev/ttyUSB0
      crw-rw----    1    root    plugdev    188,    1    Jul    10    19:04    /dev/ttyUSB1
   ```

   The `/dev/ttyUSBn` interface with the lower number is used for JTAG communication\. The other interface is routed to the ESP32's serial port \(UART\) and is used for uploading code to the ESP32's flash memory\.

1. In a terminal window, navigate to the root of your FreeRTOS download directory, and use the following command to run OpenOCD\.

   ```
   idf.py openocd 
   ```

1. Open another terminal, navigate to the root of your FreeRTOS download directory, and run the following command\.

   ```
   idf.py flash monitor 
   ```

1. Open another terminal, navigate the root of your FreeRTOS download directory, and run the following command:

   ```
   idf.py gdb
   ```

   The program should stop in `main()`\.
