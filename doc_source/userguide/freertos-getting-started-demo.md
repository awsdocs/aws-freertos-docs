# FreeRTOS demo application<a name="freertos-getting-started-demo"></a>

The demo application in this tutorial is the coreMQTT Agent demo defined in the `freertos/demos/coreMQTT_Agent/mqtt_agent_task.c` file\. It uses  the [coreMQTT library](coremqtt.md) to connect to the AWS Cloud and then periodically publish messages to an MQTT topic hosted by the [AWS IoT MQTT broker](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/mqtt.html)\.

Only a single FreeRTOS demo application can run at a time\. When you build a FreeRTOS demo project, the first demo enabled in the `freertos/vendors/vendor/boards/board/aws_demos/config_files/aws_demo_config.h` header file is the application that runs\. For this tutorial, you do not need to enable or disable any demos\. The coreMQTT Agent demo is enabled by default\.
