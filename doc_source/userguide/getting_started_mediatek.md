# Getting Started with the MediaTek MT7697Hx Development Kit<a name="getting_started_mediatek"></a>

This tutorial provides instructions for getting started with the MediaTek MT7697Hx Development Kit\. If you do not have the MediaTek MT7697Hx Development Kit, visit the AWS Partner Device Catalog to purchase one from our [partner](https://devices.amazonaws.com/detail/a3G0L00000AAOmPUAX/MT7697Hx-Development-Kit)\.

Before you begin, you must configure AWS IoT and your Amazon FreeRTOS download to connect your device to the AWS Cloud\. See [First Steps](freertos-prereqs.md) for instructions\. In this tutorial, the path to the Amazon FreeRTOS download directory is referred to as `<amazon-freertos>`\.

## Overview<a name="w12aab7c25c26b7"></a>

This tutorial contains instructions for the following getting started steps:

1. Installing software on the host machine for developing and debugging embedded applications for your microcontroller board\.

1. Cross compiling an Amazon FreeRTOS demo application to a binary image\.

1. Loading the application binary image to your board, and then running the application\.

1. Interacting with the application running on your board across a serial connection, for monitoring and debugging purposes\.

## Set Up Your Development Environment<a name="mediatek-setup-env"></a>

Before you set up your environment, connect your computer to the USB port on the MediaTek MT7697Hx Development Kit\.

### Download and Install Keil MDK<a name="install-keil-mdk"></a>

You can use the GUI\-based Keil Microcontroller Development Kit \(MDK\) to configure, build, and run Amazon FreeRTOS projects on your board\. Keil MDK includes the μVision IDE and the μVision Debugger\.

**Note**  
Keil MDK is supported on Windows 7, Windows 8, and Windows 10 64\-bit machines only\.

**To download and install Keil MDK**

1. Go to the [Keil MDK Getting Started](http://www2.keil.com/mdk5/install/) page, and choose **Download MDK\-Core**\.

1. Enter and submit your information to register with Keil\.

1. Right\-click the MDK executable and save the Keil MDK installer to your computer\.

1. Open the Keil MDK installer and follow the steps to completion\. Make sure that you install the MediaTek device pack \(MT76x7 Series\)\.

## Establish a Serial Connection<a name="mediatek-serial-connection"></a>

To establish a serial connection with the MediaTek MT7697Hx Development Kit, you must install the Arm Mbed Windows serial port driver\. You can download the driver from [Mbed](https://os.mbed.com/docs/latest/tutorials/windows-serial-driver.html)\. Follow the steps on the **Windows serial driver** page to download and install the driver for the MediaTek MT7697Hx Development Kit\. 

After you install the driver, a COM port appears in the Windows Device Manager\. For debugging, you can open a session to the port with a terminal utility tool such as HyperTerminal or TeraTerm\.

**Note**  
If you are having trouble connecting to your board after you install the driver, you might need to reboot your machine\.

## Build and Run the Amazon FreeRTOS Demo Project with Keil MDK<a name="mediatek-build-and-run-keil"></a>

**To build the Amazon FreeRTOS demo project in Keil μVision**

1. From the **Start** menu, open Keil μVision 5\.

1. Open the `projects/mediatek/mt7697hx-dev-kit/uvision/aws_demos/aws_demos.uvprojx` project file\.

1. From the menu, choose **Project**, and then choose **Build target**\.

   After the code is built, you see the demo executable file at `projects/mediatek/mt7697hx-dev-kit/uvision/aws_demos/out/Objects/aws_demo.axf`\.

**To run the Amazon FreeRTOS demo project**

1. Set the MediaTek MT7697Hx Development Kit to PROGRAM mode\.

   To set the kit to PROGRAM mode, press and hold the **PROG** button\. With the **PROG** button still pressed, press and release the **RESET** button, and then release the **PROG** button\.

1. From the menu, choose **Flash**, and then choose **Configure Flash Tools**\.

1. In **Options for Target '`aws_demo`'**, choose the **Debug** tab\. Select **Use**, set the debugger to **CMSIS\-DAP Debugger**, and then choose **OK**\.

1. From the menu, choose **Flash**, and then choose **Download**\.

   μVision notifies you when the download is complete\.

1. Use a terminal utility to open the serial console window\. Set the serial port to 115200 bps, none\-parity, 8\-bits, and 1 stop\-bit\.

1. Choose the **RESET** button on your MediaTek MT7697Hx Development Kit\.

### Monitoring MQTT Messages on the Cloud<a name="gsg-mediatek-monitor-mqtt"></a>

You can use the MQTT client in the AWS IoT console to monitor the messages that your device sends to the AWS Cloud\.

**To subscribe to the MQTT topic with the AWS IoT MQTT client**

1. Sign in to the [AWS IoT console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iotv2/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Test** to open the MQTT client\.

1. In **Subscription topic**, enter **iotdemo/\#**, and then choose **Subscribe to topic**\.

## Troubleshooting<a name="mediatek-troubleshooting"></a>

### Debugging Amazon FreeRTOS Projects in Keil μVision<a name="mediatek-debugging"></a>

Currently, you must edit the MediaTek package that is included with Keil μVision before you can debug the Amazon FreeRTOS demo project for MediaTek with Keil μVision\.

**To edit the MediaTek package for debugging Amazon FreeRTOS projects**

1. Find and open the `Keil_v5\ARM\PACK\.Web\MediaTek.MTx.pdsc` file in your Keil MDK installation folder\.

1. Replace all instances of `flag = Read32(0x20000000);` with `flag = Read32(0x0010FBFC);`\.

1. Replace all instances of `Write32(0x20000000, 0x76877697);` with `Write32(0x0010FBFC, 0x76877697);`\.

**To start debugging the project**

1. From the menu, choose **Flash**, and then choose **Configure Flash Tools**\.

1. Choose the **Target** tab, and then choose **Read/Write Memory Areas**\. Confirm that IRAM1 and IRAM2 are both selected\.

1. Choose the **Debug** tab, and then choose **CMSIS\-DAP Debugger**\.

1. Open `vendors/mediatek/boards/mt7697hx-dev-kit/aws_demos/application_code/main.c`, and set the macro `MTK_DEBUGGER` to `1`\. 

1. Rebuild the demo project in μVision\. 

1. Set the MediaTek MT7697Hx Development Kit to PROGRAM mode\.

   To set the kit to PROGRAM mode, press and hold the **PROG** button\. With the **PROG** button still pressed, press and release the **RESET** button, and then release the **PROG** button\.

1. From the menu, choose **Flash**, and then choose **Download**\. 

   μVision notifies you when the download is complete\.

1. Press the **RESET** button on your MediaTek MT7697Hx Development Kit\.

1. From the μVision menu, choose **Debug**, and then choose **Start/Stop Debug Session**\. The **Call Stack \+ Locals** window opens when you start the debug session\.  

1. From the menu, choose **Debug**, and then choose **Stop** to pause the code execution\. The program counter stops at the following line: 

   ```
   { volatile int wait_ice = 1 ; while ( wait_ice ) ; }
   ```

1. In the **Call Stack \+ Locals** window, change the value for `wait_ice` to `0`\. 

1. Set breakpoints in your project's source code, and run the code\. 

### Troubleshooting the IDE Debugger Settings<a name="gsg-mediatek-ts-ide"></a>

If you are having trouble debugging an application, your debugger settings might be incorrect\.

**To verify that your debugger settings are correct**

1. Open Keil μVision\.

1. Right\-click the `aws_demos` project, choose **Options**, and under the **Utilities** tab, choose **Settings**, next to **“\-\- Use Debug Driver \-\-”**\.

1. Verify that the settings under the **Debug** tab appear as follows:  
![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/freertos/latest/userguide/images/mediatek-debug-2.png)

1. Verify that the settings under the **Flash Download** tab appear as follows:
