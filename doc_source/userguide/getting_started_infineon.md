# Getting Started with the Infineon XMC4800 IoT Connectivity Kit<a name="getting_started_infineon"></a>

This tutorial provides instructions for getting started with the Infineon XMC4800 IoT Connectivity Kit\. If you do not have the Infineon XMC4800 IoT Connectivity Kit, visit the AWS Partner Device Catalog to purchase one from our [partner](https://devices.amazonaws.com/detail/a3G0L00000AANsbUAH/XMC4800-IoT-Amazon-FreeRTOS-Connectivity-Kit-WiFi)\.

If you want to open a serial connection with the board to view logging and debugging information, you need a 3\.3V USB/Serial converter, in addition to the XMC4800 IoT Connectivity Kit\. The CP2104 is a common USB/Serial converter that is widely available in boards such as Adafruit's [CP2104 Friend](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3309)\.

Before you begin, you must configure AWS IoT and your Amazon FreeRTOS download to connect your device to the AWS Cloud\. See [First Steps](freertos-prereqs.md) for instructions\. In this tutorial, the path to the Amazon FreeRTOS download directory is referred to as `<amazon-freertos>`\.

## Overview<a name="w12aab7c25c18b9"></a>

This tutorial contains instructions for the following getting started steps:

1. Installing software on the host machine for developing and debugging embedded applications for your microcontroller board\.

1. Cross compiling an Amazon FreeRTOS demo application to a binary image\.

1. Loading the application binary image to your board, and then running the application\.

1. Interacting with the application running on your board across a serial connection, for monitoring and debugging purposes\.

## Set Up Your Development Environment<a name="infineon-setup-env"></a>

Amazon FreeRTOS uses Infineon's DAVE development environment to program the XMC4800\. Before you begin, you need to download and install DAVE and some J\-Link drivers to communicate with the on\-board debugger\.

### Install DAVE<a name="install-dave"></a>

1. Go to Infineon's [DAVE software download](https://infineoncommunity.com/dave-download_ID645) page\.

1. Choose the DAVE package for your operating system and submit your registration information\. After registering with Infineon, you should receive a confirmation email with a link to download a \.zip file\.

1. Download the DAVE package \.zip file \(`DAVE_version_os_date.zip`\), and unzip it to the location where you want to install DAVE \(for example, `C:\DAVE4`\)\. 
**Note**  
Some Windows users have reported problems using Windows Explorer to unzip the file\. We recommend that you use a third\-party program such as 7\-Zip\.

1. To launch DAVE, run the executable file found in the unzipped `DAVE_version_os_date.zip` folder\.

For more information, see the [DAVE Quick Start Guide](https://www.infineon.com/dgdl/Infineon-DAVE_Quick_Start-GS-v02_00-EN.pdf?fileId=5546d4624cb7f111014d059f7b8c712d)\.

### Install Segger J\-Link Drivers<a name="install-jlink"></a>

To communicate with the XMC4800 Relax EtherCAT board's on\-board debugging probe, you need the drivers included in the J\-Link Software and Documentation pack\. You can download the J\-Link Software and Documentation pack from Segger's [J\-Link software download](https://www.segger.com/downloads/jlink/#J-LinkSoftwareAndDocumentationPack) page\.

## Establish a Serial Connection<a name="install-serial-connection"></a>

Setting up a serial connection is optional, but recommended\. A serial connection allows your board to send logging and debugging information in a form that you can view on your development machine\.

The XMC4800 demo application uses a UART serial connection on pins P0\.0 and P0\.1, which are labeled on the XMC4800 Relax EtherCAT board's silkscreen\. To set up a serial connection:

1. Connect the pin labeled “RX<P0\.0” to your USB/Serial converter's “TX” pin\.

1. Connect the pin labeled “TX>P0\.1” to your USB/Serial converter's “RX” pin\.

1. Connect your serial converter's Ground pin to one of the pins labeled “GND” on your board\. The devices must share a common ground\.

Power is supplied from the USB debugging port, so do not connect your serial adapter's positive voltage pin to the board\.

**Note**  
Some serial cables use a 5V signaling level\. The XMC4800 board and the Wi\-Fi Click module require a 3\.3V\. Do not use the board's IOREF jumper to change the board's signals to 5V\.

 With the cable connected, you can open a serial connection on a terminal emulator such as [GNU Screen](https://www.gnu.org/software/screen/)\. The baud rate is set to 115200 by default with 8 data bits, no parity, and 1 stop bit\. 

## Build and Run the Amazon FreeRTOS Demo Project<a name="infineon-build-and-run-example"></a>

### Import the Amazon FreeRTOS Demo into DAVE<a name="infineon-freertos-import-project"></a><a name="infineon-load-project"></a>

1. Start DAVE\.

1. In DAVE, choose **File**, **Import**\. In the **Import** window, expand the **Infineon** folder, choose **DAVE Project**, and then choose **Next**\.

1. In the **Import DAVE Projects** window, choose **Select Root Directory**, choose **Browse**, and then choose the XMC4800 demo project\.

   In the directory where you unzipped your Amazon FreeRTOS download, the demo project is located in `projects/infineon/xmc4800_iotkit/dave4/aws_demos`\. 

   Make sure that **Copy Projects Into Workspace** is unchecked\.

1. Choose **Finish**\.

   The `aws_demos` project should be imported into your workspace and activated\.

1. From the **Project** menu, choose **Build Active Project**\.

   Make sure that the project builds without errors\.

### Run the Amazon FreeRTOS Demo Project<a name="infineon-run-examples"></a>

1. Use a USB cable to connect your XMC4800 IoT Connectivity Kit to your computer\. The board has two microUSB connectors\. Use the one labeled “X101”, where Debug appears next to it on the board's silkscreen\.

1. From the **Project** menu, choose **Rebuild Active Project** to rebuild `aws_demos` and ensure that your configuration changes are picked up\.

1. From **Project Explorer**, right\-click `aws_demos`, choose **Debug As**, and then choose **DAVE C/C\+\+ Application**\.

1. Double\-click **GDB SEGGER J\-Link Debugging** to create a debug confirmation\. Choose **Debug**\.

1. When the debugger stops at the breakpoint in `main()`, from the **Run** menu, choose **Resume**\.

In the AWS IoT console, the MQTT client from steps 4\-5 should display the MQTT messages sent by your device\. If you use the serial connection, you see something like this on the UART output:

### Build the Amazon FreeRTOS demo with CMake<a name="infineon-cmake"></a>

If you prefer not to use an IDE for Amazon FreeRTOS development, you can alternatively use CMake to build and run the demo applications or applications that you have developed using third\-party code editors and debugging tools\.

**Note**  
This section covers using CMake on Windows with MingW as the native build system\. For more information about using CMake with other operating systems and options, see [Using CMake with Amazon FreeRTOS](getting-started-cmake.md)\.

**To build the Amazon FreeRTOS demo with CMake**

1. Set up the GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain\.

   1. Download a Windows version of the toolchain from the [Arm Embedded Toolchain download page](https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/open-source-software/developer-tools/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm/downloads)\.
**Note**  
We recommend that you download a version other than "8\-2018\-q4\-major", due to [a bug reported](https://bugs.launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded/+bug/1810274) with the “objcopy” utility in that version\.

   1. Open the downloaded toolchain installer, and follow the installation wizard's instructions to install the toolchain\.
**Important**  
On the final page of the installation wizard, select **Add path to environment variable** to add the toolchain path to the system path environment variable\.

1. Install CMake and MingW\.

   For instructions, see [CMake Prerequisites](building-cmake-prereqs.md)\.

1. Create a folder to contain the generated build files \(*BUILD\_FOLDER*\)\.

1. Change directories to your Amazon FreeRTOS download directory \(`<amazon-freertos>`\), and use the following command to generate the build files:

   ```
   cmake -DVENDOR=infineon -DBOARD=xmc4800_iotkit -DCOMPILER=arm-gcc -S . -B BUILD_FOLDER -G "MinGW Makefiles" -DAFR_ENABLE_TESTS=0
   ```

1. Change directories to the build directory \(*BUILD\_FOLDER*\), and use the following command to build the binary:

   ```
   cmake --build . --parallel 8
   ```

   This command builds the output binary `aws_demos.hex` to the build directory\.

1. Flash and run the image with [JLINK](#install-jlink)\.

   1. From the build directory \(*BUILD\_FOLDER*\), use the following commands to create a flash script:

      ```
      echo loadfile aws_demos.hex > flash.jlink
      ```

      ```
      echo r >> flash.jlink
      ```

      ```
      echo g >> flash.jlink
      ```

      ```
      echo q >> flash.jlink
      ```

   1. Flash the image using the JLNIK executable\.

      ```
      JLINK_PATH\JLink.exe  -device XMC4800-2048 -if SWD -speed auto -CommanderScript flash.jlink
      ```

      The application logs should be visible through [the serial connection](#install-serial-connection) that you established with the board\.

### Monitoring MQTT Messages on the Cloud<a name="w12aab7c25c18c15b9"></a>

You can use the MQTT client in the AWS IoT console to monitor the messages that your device sends to the AWS Cloud\.

**To subscribe to the MQTT topic with the AWS IoT MQTT client**

1. Sign in to the [AWS IoT console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iotv2/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Test** to open the MQTT client\.

1. In **Subscription topic**, enter **iotdemo/\#**, and then choose **Subscribe to topic**\.
