# Amazon FreeRTOS Libraries<a name="dev-guide-freertos-libraries"></a>

Amazon FreeRTOS libraries provide additional functionality to the FreeRTOS kernel and its internal libraries\. You can use Amazon FreeRTOS libraries for networking and security in embedded applications\. Amazon FreeRTOS libraries also enable your applications to interact with AWS IoT services\.

The `libraries` directory contains the source code of the Amazon FreeRTOS libraries\. There are helper functions that assist in implementing the library functionality\. We do not recommend that you change these helper functions\.

## Amazon FreeRTOS Porting Libraries<a name="dev-guide-freertos-porting-libraries"></a>

The following porting libraries are included in configurations of Amazon FreeRTOS that are available for download on the Amazon FreeRTOS console\. These libraries are platform\-dependent\. Their contents change according to your hardware platform\. For information about porting these libraries to a device, see the [Amazon FreeRTOS Porting Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/freertos/latest/portingguide/)\.

## Configuring the Amazon FreeRTOS Libraries<a name="lib-config"></a>

Configuration settings for Amazon FreeRTOS and the AWS IoT Device SDK for Embedded C are defined as C preprocessor constants\. You can set configuration settings with a global configuration file, or by using a compiler option such as `-D` in `gcc`\. Because configuration settings are defined as compile\-time constants, a library must be rebuilt if a configuration setting is changed\.

If you want to use a global configuration file to set configuration options, create and save the file with the name `iot_config.h`, and place it in your include path\. Within the file, use `#define` directives to configure the Amazon FreeRTOS libraries, demos, and tests\.

For more information about the supported global configuration options, see the [Global Configuration File Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/freertos/latest/lib-ref/c-sdk/main/global_library_config.html#IOT_CONFIG_FILE)\.
