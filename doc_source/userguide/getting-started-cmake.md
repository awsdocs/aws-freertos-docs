# Using CMake with Amazon FreeRTOS<a name="getting-started-cmake"></a>

You can use CMake to generate project build files from Amazon FreeRTOS application source code\.

If you prefer working without an IDE, you can use other third\-party code editing and debugging tools for developing and debugging your code, and then use CMake to build and run the applications\.

The following boards support CMake:
+ Espressif ESP32\-DevKitC
+ Espressif ESP\-WROVER\-KIT
+ Infineon XMC4800 IoT Connectivity Kit
+ Marvell MW320 AWS IoT Starter Kit
+ Marvell MW322 AWS IoT Starter Kit
+ Microchip Curiosity PIC32MZEF Bundle
+ Nordic nRF52840 DK Development kit
+ STMicroelectronicsSTM32L4 Discovery Kit IoT Node
+ Texas Instruments CC3220SF\-LAUNCHXL
+ Microsoft Windows Simulator
