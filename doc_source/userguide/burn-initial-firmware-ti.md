1. In the **File** selector pane, choose the **Add File** icon ![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/freertos/latest/userguide/images/add-file.png)\.

1. Browse to the working directory where you created the code\-signing certificate and private key, choose `tisigner.crt.der`, choose **Open**, and then choose **Write**\.

1. From the **Action** drop\-down list, choose **Select MCU Image**, and then choose **Browse** to choose the firmware image to use write to your device \(**aws\_demos\.bin**\)\. This file is located in the `<amazon-freertos>/vendors/ti/boards/cc3220_launchpad/aws_demos/ccs/Debug` directory\. Choose **Open**\.

   1. In the file dialog box, confirm the file name is set to `mcuflashimg.bin`\.

   1. Select the **Vendor** check box\.

   1. Under **File Token**, type **1952007250**\.

   1. Under **Private Key File Name**, choose **Browse**, and then choose `tisigner.key` from the working directory where you created the code\-signing certificate and private key\.

   1. Under **Certification File Name**, choose `tisigner.crt.der`\.

   1. Choose **Write**\.

1. In the left pane, under **Files**, choose **Service Pack**\.

1. Under **Service Pack File Name**, choose **Browse**, browse to `simplelink_cc32x_sdk_version/tools/cc32xx_tools/servicepack-cc3x20`, choose `sp_3.7.0.1_2.0.0.0_2.2.0.6.bin`, and then choose **Open**\.

1. In the left pane, under **Files**, choose **Trusted Root\-Certificate Catalog**\.

1. Clear the **Use default Trusted Root\-Certificate Catalog** check box\.

1. Under **Source File**, choose **Browse**, choose **simplelink\_cc32xx\_sdk\_*version*/tools/cc32xx\_tools/certificate\-playground/certcatalogPlayGround20160911\.lst**, and then choose **Open**\.

1. Under **Signature Source File**, choose **Browse**, choose **simplelink\_cc32xx\_sdk\_*version*/tools/cc32xx\_tools/certificate\-playground/certcatalogPlayGround20160911\.lst\.signed\_3220\.bin**, and then choose **Open**\.

1. Choose the ![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/freertos/latest/userguide/images/save.png) button to save your project\.

1. Choose the ![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/freertos/latest/userguide/images/flame.png) button\.

1. Choose **Program Image \(Create and Program\)**\.

1. After the programming process is complete, place the SOP jumper onto the first set of pins \(position = 0\), reset the board, and reconnect your terminal emulator to make sure the output is the same as when you debugged the demo with Code Composer Studio\. Make a note of the application version number in the terminal output\. You use this version number later to verify that your firmware has been updated by an OTA update\.

   The terminal should display output like the following\.
