# Create an Amazon S3 bucket to store your update<a name="dg-ota-bucket"></a>

OTA update files are stored in Amazon S3 buckets\.

If you're using Code Signing for AWS IoT, the command that you use to create a code\-signing job takes a source bucket \(where the unsigned firmware image is located\) and a destination bucket \(where the signed firmware image is written\)\. You can specify the same bucket for the source and destination\. The file names are changed to GUIDs so the original files are not overwritten\.<a name="create-bucket"></a>
