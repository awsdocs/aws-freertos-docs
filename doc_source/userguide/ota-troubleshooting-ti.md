# Troubleshoot OTA Updates with the Texas Instruments CC3220SF Launchpad<a name="ota-troubleshooting-ti"></a>

The CC3220SF Launchpad platform provides a software tamper\-detection mechanism\. It uses a security alert counter that is incremented whenever there is an integrity violation\. The device is locked when the security alert counter reaches a predetermined threshold \(the default is 15\) and the host receives the `SL_ERROR_DEVICE_LOCKED_SECURITY_ALERT` asynchronous event\. The locked device then has limited accessibility\. To recover the device, you can reprogram it or use the restore\-to\-factory process to revert to the factory image\. You should program the desired behavior by updating the asynchronous event handler in `network_if.c`\.
