# AWS IoT Device Defender Demo<a name="dd-demo"></a>

Amazon FreeRTOS includes a single\-threaded demo application that collects some AWS IoT Device Defender metrics for a device and publishes them to an MQTT topic\. This demo is defined in `<amazon-freertos>/demos/defender/aws_iot_defender_demo.c`\.

Before you can run the Device Defender demo, you must complete the getting started [First Steps](freertos-prereqs.md) to set up AWS IoT and Amazon FreeRTOS so your device can communicate with the AWS cloud\.

 Open `<amazon-freertos>/vendors/<vendor>/boards/<board>/aws_demos/config_files/aws_demo_config.h`, comment out `#define CONFIG_MQTT_DEMO_ENABLED`, and define `CONFIG_DEFENDER_DEMO_ENABLED`\.

When you build, flash, and run Amazon FreeRTOS on your device with the Device Defender demo enabled, the following output should appear:

```
