# Use the IDT for FreeRTOS user interface to run the FreeRTOS qualification suite<a name="device-tester-ui"></a>

Starting with IDT v4\.3\.0, AWS IoT Device Tester for FreeRTOS \(IDT\-FreeRTOS\) includes a web\-based user interface that enables you to interact with the IDT command line executable and related configuration files\. You can use the IDT\-FreeRTOS UI to create a new configuration to run IDT tests, or to modify an existing configuration\. You can also use the UI to invoke the IDT executable and run tests\. 

The IDT\-FreeRTOS UI provides the following functions:
+ Simplify setting up configuration files for IDT\-FreeRTOS tests\.
+ Simplify using IDT\-FreeRTOS to run qualification tests\. 

For information about the using the command line to run qualification tests, see [Preparing to test your microcontroller board for the first time](qual-steps.md)\.

This section describes the prerequisites for using the IDT\-FreeRTOS UI, and shows you how to get started running qualification tests in the UI\.
