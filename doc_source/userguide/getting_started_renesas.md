# Getting Started with the Renesas Starter Kit\+ for RX65N\-2MB<a name="getting_started_renesas"></a>

This tutorial provides instructions for getting started with the Renesas Starter Kit\+ for RX65N\-2MB\. If you do not have the Renesas RSK\+ for RX65N\-2MB, visit the AWS Partner Device Catalog, and purchase one from our [partners](https://devices.amazonaws.com/detail/a3G0L00000AAOkeUAH/Renesas-Starter-Kit+-for-RX65N-2MB)\.

Before you begin, you must configure AWS IoT and your Amazon FreeRTOS download to connect your device to the AWS Cloud\. See [First Steps](freertos-prereqs.md) for instructions\. In this tutorial, the path to the Amazon FreeRTOS download directory is referred to as `<amazon-freertos>`\.

## Overview<a name="gsg-renesas-overview"></a>

This tutorial contains instructions for the following getting started steps:

1. Connecting your board to a host machine\.

1. Installing software on the host machine for developing and debugging embedded applications for your microcontroller board\.

1. Cross compiling an Amazon FreeRTOS demo application to a binary image\.

1. Loading the application binary image to your board, and then running the application\.

## Set Up the Renesas Hardware<a name="renesas-setup-hardware"></a>

**To set up the RSK\+ for RX65N\-2MB**

1. Connect the positive \+5V power adapter to the PWR connector on the RSK\+ for RX65N\-2MB\.

1. Connect your computer to the USB2\.0 FS port on the RSK\+ for RX65N\-2MB\.

1. Connect your computer to the USB\-to\-serial port on the RSK\+ for RX65N\-2MB\.

1. Connect a router or internet\-connected Ethernet port to the Ethernet port on the RSK\+ for RX65N\-2MB\.

**To set up the E2 Lite Debugger module**

1. Use the 14\-pin ribbon cable to connect the E2 Lite Debugger module to the ‘E1/E2 Lite’ port on the RSK\+ for RX65N\-2MB\.

1. Use a USB cable to connect the E2 Lite debugger module to your host machine\. When the E2 Lite debugger is connected to both the board and your computer, a green ‘ACT’ LED on the debugger flashes\.

1. After the debugger is connected to your host machine and RSK\+ for RX65N\-2MB, the E2 Lite debugger drivers begin installing\.

   Note that administrator privileges are required to install the drivers\.

**Note**  
The compiler is available free for evaluation version only and valid for 60 days\. On the 61st day, you need to get a License Key\. For more information, see [Evaluation Software Tools](https://www.renesas.com/us/en/products/software-tools/evaluation-software-tools.html)\.

## Build and Run Amazon FreeRTOS Samples<a name="renesas-build-and-run-example"></a>

Now that you have configured the demo project, you are ready to build and run the project on your board\.

### Build the Amazon FreeRTOS Demo in e2studio<a name="renesas-freertos-import-project"></a>

**To import and build the demo in e2studio**

1. Launch e2studio from the Start menu\.
