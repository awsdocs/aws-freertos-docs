# AWS Qualification Program for FreeRTOS<a name="afr-qualification"></a>

## What is FreeRTOS<a name="afr-qualification-what-is"></a>

Developed in partnership with the world's leading chip companies over a 15\-year period, and now downloaded every 175 seconds, FreeRTOS is a market\-leading real\-time operating system \(RTOS\) for microcontrollers and small microprocessors\. Distributed freely under the MIT open source license, FreeRTOS includes a kernel and a growing set of libraries suitable for use across all industry sectors\. FreeRTOS is built with an emphasis on reliability and ease of use\.

FreeRTOS includes libraries for connectivity, security, and over\-the\-air \(OTA\) updates\. FreeRTOS also includes demo applications that show FreeRTOS features on [qualified boards](https://devices.amazonaws.com/search?page=1&sv=freertos)\.

FreeRTOS is an open\-source project\. You can download the source code, contribute changes or enhancements, or report issues on the GitHub site at [ https://github\.com/aws/amazon\-freertos](https://github.com/aws/amazon-freertos)\. We release FreeRTOS code under the MIT open source license, so you can use it in commercial and personal projects\.

We also welcome contributions to the FreeRTOS documentation \(*FreeRTOS User Guide*, *FreeRTOS Porting Guide*, and *FreeRTOS Qualification Guide*\)\. The markdown source for the documentation is available at [https://github\.com/awsdocs/aws\-freertos\-docs](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-freertos-docs)\. It is released under the Creative Commons \(CC BY\-ND\) license\.

The FreeRTOS kernel and components are released individually and use semantic versioning\. Integrated FreeRTOS releases are made periodically\.  All releases use date\-based versioning with the format YYYYMM\.NN, where:
+ Y represents the year\.
+ M represents the month\.
+ N represents the release order within the designated month \(00 being the first release\)\.

For example, a second release in July 2021 would be 202107\.01\. 

Previously, FreeRTOS releases used semantic versioning for major releases\. Although it has moved to date\-based versioning \(FreeRTOS 1\.4\.8 updated to FreeRTOS AWS Reference Integrations 201906\.00\), the FreeRTOS kernel and each individual FreeRTOS library still retain semantic versioning\. In semantic versioning, the version number itself \(X\.Y\.Z\) indicates whether the release is a major, minor, or point release\.  You can use the semantic version of a library to assess the scope and impact of a new release on your application\.

LTS releases are maintained differently than other release types\. Major and minor releases are frequently updated with new features in addition to defect resolutions\. LTS releases are only updated with changes to address critical defects and security vulnerabilities\. No new features are introduced in a given LTS release after launch\. They are maintained for at least three calendar years after release, and provide device manufacturers the option to use a stable baseline as opposed to a more dynamic baseline represented by major and minor releases\.

## What is the AWS Qualification Program for FreeRTOS?<a name="afr-qualification-what-is-qualp"></a>

The [AWS Device Qualification Program for FreeRTOS](https://aws.amazon.com/partners/dqp/) validates pre\-integrated FreeRTOS projects ported to microcontroller\-based boards, giving developers confidence that the FreeRTOS port behaves correctly and consistently with AWS IoT\. 

Those in the Amazon Partner Network can use the AWS Device Qualification Program to officially qualify a microcontroller \(MCU\) development board for FreeRTOS\.

Qualified boards are eligible for listing on the [AWS Partner Device Catalog](https://devices.amazonaws.com/search?page=1&sv=freertos)\.

To qualify a device for FreeRTOS, you must port FreeRTOS to your device, and then follow the AWS Device Qualification Program steps\. For information, see the [AWS Device Qualification Program page](https://aws.amazon.com/partners/dqp/) and the [ AWS Device Qualification Program Guide](https://partnercentral.awspartner.com/sfc/#version?selectedDocumentId=0690L000005HXjb)\.

For information about qualifying your device for FreeRTOS, see [Qualifying your device](freertos-qualification.md)\.

### Qualification FAQs<a name="afr-qualification-faqs"></a>

Q: *Can I qualify an MCU that doesn't have Wi\-Fi or Ethernet?*  
A: Yes\. There are qualified MCUs that use external Wi\-Fi modules and offload various functions to the Wi\-Fi module, including TCP/IP and TLS\. An example is the STM32L4 Discovery Kit that uses an Inventek Wi\-Fi module\. Follow the [Device Qualification Program submittal process](https://aws.amazon.com/partners/dqp/) and let us know how we can help with your efforts\.

Q: *If a version of FreeRTOS is released after I have started porting a previous version, do I need to start over using the latest version?*  
A: Always start porting the latest version of FreeRTOS\. If we release a new version of FreeRTOS while you are working on your port, you can still qualify on the previous version\.

Q: *My board uses a kernel architecture that I have modified and that is not part of the official FreeRTOS release\. Can I still qualify?*   
A: Unfortunately, only official kernel ports are accepted\. These are available from [GitHub](https://github.com/aws/amazon-freertos)\. If you have an unsupported architecture or additional functionality to add to an existing kernel port, contact your local APN representative\.

Q: *If I want to update a port listed on the Device Catalog to a newer version of FreeRTOS, do I need to qualify all over again?*   
A: After you have updated your port, run the AWS IoT Device Tester again and check the [FreeRTOS qualification checklist](afq-checklist.md) to see if any items have been impacted \(especially the Getting Started Guide\)\. Submit a Device Qualification Program ticket with a copy of your passing log to update the Device Catalog listing to point to your new port\. 

Q: *My device does not support Wi\-Fi\. Is a port of the FreeRTOS Wi\-Fi library required to qualify for FreeRTOS?*  
A: The primary requirement is that your device can connect to the AWS Cloud\. If your device can connect to the AWS Cloud across a secure Ethernet connection, the Wi\-Fi library is not a requirement\.

Q: *My device does not support Bluetooth Low Energy or over\-the\-air \(OTA\) updates\. Are ports for these FreeRTOS libraries required to qualify for FreeRTOS?*  
A: Bluetooth Low Energy and OTA ports are optional for qualification\.

Q: *My board does not have on\-chip TCP/IP functionality\. Is a particular TCP/IP stack required for FreeRTOS qualification?*  
A: If your board does not have on\-chip TCP/IP functionality, you can use either the FreeRTOS\+TCP TCP/IP stack or the latest version of the lwIP TCP/IP stack to pass TCP/IP qualification requirements\. For the latest version of lwIP supported by FreeRTOS, see the [ changelog\.md file](https://github.com/aws/amazon-freertos/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) on the GitHub website\. For more information, see [Porting a TCP/IP Stack](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/freertos/latest/portingguide/afr-porting-tcp.html) in the *FreeRTOS Porting Guide*\.

Q: *Is a particular TLS stack required for qualification?*  
A: FreeRTOS supports mbedTLS and off\-chip TLS implementations, such as those found on some network processors\. No matter which TLS implementation is used by your device's port of FreeRTOS, the port must pass the Device Tester validation tests for TLS\. For more information, see [Porting the TLS Library](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/freertos/latest/portingguide/afr-porting-tls.html) in the *FreeRTOS Porting Guide*\.

Q: *Does my device need to pass all of the AWS IoT Device Tester validation tests to qualify? Is there a way to qualify without passing all of the tests?*  
A: Your device must pass all of the required validation tests to qualify for FreeRTOS\. The only exceptions are for Wi\-Fi, Bluetooth Low Energy, and OTA\.

Q: *My device uses only one of the protocols \(HTTP, MQTT\) and only one of the available communication channels \(Wi\-Fi, Ethernet, BLE\)\. If all the OTA related IDT tests pass using just one protocol\-communication channel combination, then will my device get listed as OTA qualified in the device catalog?*  
A: Yes\. We encourage you to get other combinations qualified on your device as well, if possible\. In this way, you can provide support for more customer use cases\.

Q: *We will be hosting our FreeRTOS port in our own repo as per the qualification requirements\. What should we include in the repo in terms of folders and demos to support? *  
A: Host all the files and folders necessary to make the port work as an out of the box experience for a customer who downloads it from the repository\. You should include your entire `freertos_kernel`, `libraries`, and `tools` folders, along with a `docs` folder for your documents, a `projects` folder for your IDE projects, and a `vendors` folder for your vendor\-specifc files\. Also include your entire demo folder\.   
The coreMQTT Agent demo must be supported\. Other demos are at your discretion\. Also, the `tools` folder isn't required\. However, we recommend that you host this folder to assist customers with testing\.

Q: *My device uses only cellular connectivity\. Can I still qualify?*  
A: The Cellular Interface library supports the AT commands of a TCP offloaded Cellular abstraction Layer\. These are available from [GitHub](https://github.com/FreeRTOS/FreeRTOS-Cellular-Interface)\. There are qualified devices that use the Cellular Interface library, such as the STM32L4\+ Discovery IoT Node with STEVAL\-STMODLTE that uses a Quectel BG96 cellular modem\. For more information, see [Porting the Cellular Interface library](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/freertos/latest/portingguide/freertos-porting-cellular.html) in the *FreeRTOS Porting Guide*\.
