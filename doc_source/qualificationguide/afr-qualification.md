## What is FreeRTOS<a name="afr-qualification-what-is"></a>

Developed in partnership with the world's leading chip companies over a 20\-year period, and now downloaded every 170 seconds, FreeRTOS is a market\-leading real\-time operating system \(RTOS\) for microcontrollers and small microprocessors\. Distributed freely under the MIT open source license, FreeRTOS includes a kernel and a growing set of libraries suitable for use across all industry sectors\. FreeRTOS is built with an emphasis on reliability and ease of use\. FreeRTOS includes libraries for connectivity, security, and over\-the\-air \(OTA\) updates, and demo applications that demonstrate FreeRTOS features on [qualified boards](https://devices.amazonaws.com/search?page=1&sv=freertos)\.

## What is the AWS Device Qualification Program for FreeRTOS<a name="afr-qualification-what-is-qualp"></a>

The [AWS Device Qualification Program for FreeRTOS](https://aws.amazon.com/partners/dqp/) verifies an integration of FreeRTOS AWS IoT libraries running on a specific microcontroller\-based development board is compatible with AWS's published best practices for AWS IoT Core connectivity, and robust enough to pass the [tests](https://github.com/FreeRTOS/FreeRTOS-Libraries-Integration-Tests) specified by the qualification program\.

Boards qualified under this program are listed in the [AWS Partner Device Catalog](https://devices.amazonaws.com/search?page=1&sv=freertos)\.
